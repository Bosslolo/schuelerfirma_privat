### *Problem Statement: Consumption Tracker*

At our school, students and teachers frequently consume coffee, hot chocolate, tea and other things from the caf√© machine at the cafeteria, but there is no structured way to track individual consumption. To address this, we aim to develop a *web application* that allows users to log their consumed beverages efficiently.

#### *Problem Description*
Currently, there is no automated system to monitor drink consumption among students and teachers. This leads to difficulties in tracking and fairly distributing costs. Our solution is a simple yet effective web-based application that will be *accessible via an iPad placed next to the coffee machine*.

#### *Proposed Solution*
We will create a *user-friendly web app* where each student and teacher can register their consumption by following these steps:
1. *User Authentication: The user selects their **name* from a list and enters their *personal code* to authenticate.
2. *Consumption Logging: After successful authentication, the user can **add* their consumed beverage (coffee, hot chocolate, tea, etc.) by pressing the corresponding *plus button*.
3. *Logout*: Once the entry is recorded, the user can log out.
4. *Admin Access & Monthly Report*: 
   - At the end of the month, an *admin* will review all recorded data. 
   - The system will generate an *Excel-like table* displaying:
     - *Name, number of **coffees, hot chocolates, teas, and the **total value*.
   - By clicking on a name, the admin can view *detailed consumption history, including **date and time* of each logged drink.
   - An **invoice** in form of a PDF file will be sent to each individual student/teacher via itslearning. 

#### *Expected Outcome*
- *Ease of Use*: Simple and fast logging process with minimal user input.
- *Accurate Tracking*: Transparent consumption monitoring for fair cost distribution.
- *Admin Insights*: Clear reporting with an intuitive interface to analyze consumption patterns.

This system will *increase accountability* and provide a *structured way* to manage coffee, hot chocolate, and tea consumption in our school.
