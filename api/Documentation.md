For easier collaboration, I created a postman workspace. Here is the invite link: [Postman invite](https://app.getpostman.com/join-team?invite_code=b7b820fba5b804838d3010cc814dbb76c7982e08dd8b1eb2fff41a897d43aadc&target_code=92fbe65d6bdddef0a5166de7a4703b78) 
It includes almost all requests you need to check permission, create an access token, send instant messages, upload files, etc.
