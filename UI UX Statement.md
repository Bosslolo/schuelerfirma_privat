### **UI/UX Statement: Coffee & Hot Chocolate Consumption Tracker**

#### **User Experience (UX) Vision**  
Our goal is to design a **simple, fast, and intuitive** web application that allows students and teachers to log their coffee, hot chocolate, and tea consumption effortlessly. Since the system will be used **next to a coffee machine** via an **iPad**, the interface must be **quick to navigate**, **minimally interactive**, **highly responsive**, and **have minimum latency**.

   - A **clear and structured** layout to ensure quick recognition of available actions.  
   - **Large, easy-to-tap buttons** to accommodate quick entries via touch on an iPad. 
   - A **dark/light mode option** for readability in different lighting conditions.   

2. **Fast & Intuitive Navigation**  
   - A **scrollable list of students & teachers** that allows for quick selection.  
   - A **search bar** to filter names instantly.  
   - **Simple numeric keypad** for entering the personal 4-digit code.  

3. **Efficient Consumption Logging**  
   - Once authenticated, users should **see large plus buttons** for adding coffee, hot chocolate, or tea.  
   - A **confirmation toast or animation** after each logged entry to provide feedback.  
   - A **quick logout button** to return to the user selection screen immediately.  

4. **Admin Dashboard & Reporting**  
   - A **table view** summarizing all usersâ€™ consumption for the month.  
   - Clickable **name entries** to view detailed consumption history (including date and time).  
   - **Export functionality** for generating reports in an Excel-friendly format.  
   - At the end of each month the program should automatically send an **invoice** to each student/teacher via itslearning.

#### **User Flow & Experience Enhancements**
- **Speed & Simplicity**: Users should log their drink in **3 taps or less** to minimize wait time.  
- **Error Prevention**:  
  - If an incorrect 4-digit code is entered, a **subtle shake animation** will indicate an error.  
  - A **timeout function** will log out inactive users automatically.  
- **Accessibility Considerations**:  
  - Large fonts and buttons ensure usability for all users.  
  - Color contrast to differentiate drink options.  
  - **Touch-friendly interactions** optimized for iPad screens.  

#### **Conclusion**  
This UI/UX approach ensures a **seamless, frustration-free experience** for students and teachers, while providing **accurate tracking and insightful reporting** for admins.
